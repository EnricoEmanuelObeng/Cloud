1. IaaS
    
    **Infrastructure as a Service** - Renting a server
2. PaaS

    **Platform as a Service** - Renting an enviroment (setting up the platform)
3. SaaS

    **Software as a Service** - Renting a software
4. FaaS

    **Function as a Service** - 1 off functions (Event driven)

## Market Share

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** 63% share of total enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure 
services. 
- **Microsoft Azure:** 21% share.
- **Google Cloud:** 12% share.
- These three providers account for over 60% of the global cloud market, 
with the remaining competition in the low single digits. 

## Top 3 UPS

**Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Known for its comprehensive suite of services, including cloud 
computing, networking, storage and machine learning. AWS is the market leader with a strong focus on 
security features like data encryption and compliance certifications. 

**Microsoft Azure:** Recognised for its robust identity management and security features, 
Azure offers a wide range of enterprise tools (AI + Machine Learning, Analytics, Blockchain, 
 Containers, Databases, Developer Tools, Internet of Things, Management Seurity). 

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Leading in artificial intelligence and machine learning, 
GCP is known for its integration with Google’s other products and unique security features.

| Cost-effective    | SP Dependecy      |
| Scalability       | 
| Data security     |


## Cloud pricing models

- **Pay-as-You-Go (PAYG)**
   
   Also known as on-demand, the PAYG cloud pricing model allows users to pay
only for the resources they are consuming.
- **Subscription-Based**

   this pricing model for cloud services offers a fixed set of cloud resources
for a predetermined fee, typically on a monthly or yearly basis.

- **Reserved Instances Pricing Model**

   Also known as Reserved Capacity, this model allows customers to reserve 
cloud capacity for a predetermined period, typically 1-3 years, 
in exchange for a significantly lower price compared to on-demand pricing.

- **Spot Pricing Model for Cloud**

   Prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, and users can bid for unused 
cloud capacity at potentially lower prices. However, if demand spikes or 
someone places a higher bid, you may lose access to these resources.

- You pay for the product or service received
- You don't pay for the server to be maintained

## Case studies

Gaining stakeholder buy-in is crucial. Spotify was careful to consult 
its engineers about the difficulty of mantaining data centers and would be
better to adopt a cloud computing approach.  
Migration preparation shouldn’t be rushed. Spotify’s dedicated migration 
team took the time to investigate various cloud strategies and build out 
the use case demonstrating the benefits of cloud computing to the business.
They carefully mapped all dependencies and worked with Google to
identify and orchestrate the right cloud strategies and solutions. 
Ultimately, Spotify’s on-premise to cloud migration succeeded in increasing
scalability while freeing up developers to innovate.

Waze’s stability and reliability depends on avoiding downtime, 
deploying quick fixes to bugs, and ensuring consistent production systems.
Waze decided to run an active-active architecture across multiple cloud 
providers — GCP and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — to improve the resiliency
of their production systems. Spinnaker streamlines multi-cloud deployment 
for Waze, meaning that developers can focus on development.

They sought to improve site performance, engineering efficiency, and UX.
They also wanted to ensure long-term scalability and sustainability. They 
chose GCP initially deploying a hybrid environment (private data center and 
GKE), providing redundancy, reducing risk, and allowing them to perform A/B 
testing.
 

## Main data raleted cloud service

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** – Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
   - Elastic Compute Service (Amazon EC2 for compute), Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3 for storage), and Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS for databases).
2. **Microsoft Azure** – Hybrid cloud and enterprise cloud services
3. **Google Cloud Platform** – AI, ML, and Kubernetes
   - innovations across Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Data Analytics, and Kubernetes, the popular container management platform.
4. **Alibaba** — The Largest cloud service provider in Asia
   - Alibaba Cloud supports major operations for large and small enterprises, SMEs, governments, and non-profit organizations.
5. **IBM Cloud** – Multi-cloud CSP

### Data cloud certification path

A data cloud certification path typically involves a series of credentials that 
validate a professional's skills in managing and optimising data within a cloud
environment.

## Region
- clustered data centres
- edge location - it's a ping point to extend coverage where main data centre is located too far
- availability zone - are usually 3 combined data centres connected together to form a main data centre used for redundancy and backup
